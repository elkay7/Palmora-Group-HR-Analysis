# Case Study 3: Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis

# Required:

● Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender. You would need to assign a generic gender status
to these employees

● Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company. You will need to take those employees out.

● Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments would also need to be taken out.

# Pointers from Mr Gamma

1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management.
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to payemployees a minimum of $90,000
   
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?

● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?

● Also visualize this by regions

# Case Questions

5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to:

● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees

● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive ofbonus)

● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.
